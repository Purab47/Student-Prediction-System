# Student Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the academic performance of students based on their scores in various subjects. The goal is to classify students into three performance categories: **Low**, **Average**, and **High**. The project leverages **Logistic Regression** for classification and includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation. Additionally, a **personalized recommendation system** is provided based on student performance.

## üìä **Project Overview**

In this project, a dataset of student scores across multiple subjects is used to train a machine learning model. The model predicts a student's performance category (Low, Average, or High) based on their individual subject scores. The classification task uses various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.

The project also includes a **personalized recommendation system** that gives study tips based on a student's predicted performance category. The recommendation system suggests improvement strategies to students, depending on whether their performance is categorized as Low, Average, or High.

## üß∞ **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Main programming language for model development and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data processing and handling.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library used for model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating plots such as confusion matrices.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Flask**: (Optional) Web framework if deploying the model as a web application.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression is used to predict the performance category of students based on their individual subject scores.
- **Evaluation**: The model‚Äôs performance is evaluated using classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and a confusion matrix.
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation is applied to assess the stability and generalization of the model.
- **Personalized Recommendation System**: Suggests study tips based on the student‚Äôs performance category (Low, Average, or High).
